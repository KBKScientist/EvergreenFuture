### 📈 **Scenarios** - Compare Life Choices
**This is the killer feature!**

4. Save as new scenario "Early Retirement"

6. Click **"Compare"** to see differences side-by-side

**Examples to try:**

- Move to low-cost area (cut expenses 20%)

**How to read comparisons:**

### 🎲 **Monte Carlo** - Test Against Bad Luck
Real life isn't smooth. Markets crash. Test your plan:

1. Go to **Monte Carlo** tab
2. Click **"Run Simulation"** (1000 runs)
3. Look at the 10th percentile line (bottom, red)
4. If it stays above $0 → you're probably fine
5. If it dips below $0 → you might run out in bad times

**Fix if needed:** Save more, retire later, or spend less.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Tax Optimization 🎯
The tool automatically:
- Withdraws from taxable accounts first (most tax efficient)
- Then traditional IRAs/401ks
- Then Roth (preserve these!)
- Then HSAs (best for last)

In tax bomb years (student loan forgiveness), it switches to Roth first to avoid stacking taxable income. Smart!

### RMDs (Age 73+) 🔒
Tool enforces Required Minimum Distributions from traditional accounts. You MUST withdraw starting at 73 whether you need money or not.

**Strategy:** Spend down traditional accounts before 73 to avoid forced large withdrawals in high tax brackets.

### Liquid vs Total Net Worth 💧
- **Liquid** = spendable money (investment accounts)
- **Total** = liquid + home equity
- **Focus on liquid** - you can't eat your house

---

## 🎓 Pro Tips

1. **Be conservative:** Overestimate expenses, underestimate returns. Rather be pleasantly surprised than broke.

2. **Run Monte Carlo:** If your plan barely works in smooth projections, it'll fail in real life. Need buffer!

3. **Use scenarios for everything:** Don't just wonder "what if?" - model it and know the answer!

4. **Update annually:** Come back each year, update balances, adjust assumptions. Track actual vs projected.

5. **Healthcare is expensive:** Use 5% inflation for healthcare costs, not 3%. It grows faster.

6. **Social Security:** If unsure, leave it out. Bonus if you get it!

7. **Save the current plan as a scenario FIRST** before trying wild experiments. You can always go back.

8. **Inflation matters:** $60k today ≠ $60k in 30 years. That's why everything inflates in the tool.

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "I ran out of money at age 78!"
**Fixes:**
- Increase savings rate now (even 5% helps!)
- Reduce retirement expenses 10-20%
- Retire 2-3 years later
- Assume lower returns (be more conservative)

### "My net worth goes negative"
Check:
- Did you include all income sources?
- Are expenses inflating too fast?
- Is your withdrawal strategy too aggressive?
- Run Monte Carlo - might just be unlucky simulation

### "Numbers seem wrong"
- Check income/expense frequency (monthly vs annual)
- Verify account balances are current
- Look for duplicate entries
- Check tax settings (single vs married)

## 🎯 Quick Wins

Want to improve your financial picture? Try these:

1. **Increase savings 5%:** Even small increases compound massively
2. **Delay retirement 2 years:** Huge impact (more savings + less withdrawal years)
3. **Cut one major expense:** Find your $500/month thing and eliminate it
4. **Max tax-advantaged accounts:** 401k, IRA, HSA - free money (employer match + tax savings)
5. **Pay off high-interest debt:** Credit cards at 18% APR are killing you

Model each of these as scenarios and see the $$$ impact!
